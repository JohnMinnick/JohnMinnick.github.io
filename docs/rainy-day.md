# 🌧️ Rainy Day Todo List

Things to polish when we have time. Not urgent, not blocking — just nice-to-haves.

> **Note:** John has Manim animations for demoing some projects — these can be
> rendered to video/GIF and embedded on project cards or a dedicated demos page.

## New Pages
- [ ] Blog / Writing section — research posts, tutorials, "how I built this"
- [ ] Interactive resume — visual scrollable timeline of education + work + publications
- [ ] "Now" page — what you're currently working on, reading, listening to
- [ ] Shader playground — live GLSL fragment shader editor (mini Shadertoy)

## Project Demos
- [ ] Live demo embeds — lightweight Canvas demos on project cards (e.g. spike train viz)
- [ ] Embed Manim animations as video/GIF on relevant project cards
- [ ] Add real project screenshots/thumbnails instead of emoji placeholders

## Pet System
- [ ] Improve pixel art sprites — more detail, better proportions, shadowing
- [ ] Add more walk cycle frames (4–6 instead of 2) for smoother trotting
